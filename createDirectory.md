To create a directory in CMD use *mkdir* followed by directory name

``` mkdir My_Directory ```

You can also use *md* keyword for the same purpose

``` md My_directory ```

To create multiple directories at once use *md* keyword followed by names of directories you want to create. Make sure you
leave a blank space between each directory name

``` md Folder1 Folder2 Folder3 ```

If directory name contains blank spaces wrap the name with the pair of double qoutes

``` md "My Directory" ```

See list of files and folders in current directory

``` dir ```
